              <p>Theodore "Ted" Sasso is a coach plucked from an obscure, college-level American football team in Kansas to coach in the Premier League in England.</p>
              <p>His main goals for the clubs and teams he coaches fall within the ambitions of the somewhat controversial "Ted Lasso Way". That is, he primarily seeks to help the players grow both on and off the pitch, and aims to inspire them to grow as people.</p>

              <h6>Head Coach</h6>
              <p>I know change can be scary. One minute, you are playing freeze tag out there at recess with all your buddies. Next thing you know, you’re getting zits, your voice gets low, and every time your art teacher, Ms. Scanlon, leans over your desk to check and see how your project’s going, you feel all squiggly inside. She was a striking woman. Not classically beautiful but striking. First time I ever saw tan lines. Most of the time change is a good thing and I think that’s what it’s all about – embracing change, being brave, doing whatever you have to so everyone in your life can move forward with theirs and maybe it’s the only way you can truly make her be happy.</p>
